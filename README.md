# GitaVerse

A browser extension, which gives a verse from Bhagwad Gita. (Future) Website for Bhagwad Gita

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

## Plans
- Have a website that displays the entire Bhagwad Gita in an ancient scripture like a webpage, which should feel like reading the epic itself. It would be great if someone designed it or gave some more ideas.
- My current Idea: War theme, Golden, Blue, and Royal colors, and a script-roll opening animation when the viewer clicks the verse. Book opening animation when the viewer opens the chapter. 
- Browser Extension will be just one part of the website (I have to figure out how to separate both the website and extension)

Open to contributions and suggestions! The project is still in the budding stage, and I would love to get help on this!!
